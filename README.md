### DOCUMENTATION:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/utility/download-secure-file?view=azure-devops

In this video a good practice to be able to connect to our respective cloud and project in the Google cloud. I will also tell you about a practice that I found configured in the past and I do not recommend for security issues, we will evaluate its pros and cons

# How do we create a service account?

https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts?hl=en

What are service accounts? A service account is a special type of account that is used by an application or virtual machine (VM) instance, not by a person. Applications use service accounts to make authorized API calls.

We enter the GCP web panel
Then we access through the top menu to IAM & admin
Service Accounts
We press the upper button of "+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT" We assign permissions similar to these

# Extensi√≥n "Google Cloud SDK Extension for Azure DevOps"

Azure devops extension: It allows us to extend the functionalities of the CI / CD tool and in this case it will allow us to have the google SDK client in the agents where the automations will be executed.

# Commands that we will use once connected to the cloud

  gcloud projects list
  gcloud compute instance-groups list-instances
  gcloud app instances list
  gcloud bigtable instances list
  gcloud compute instances list
  gcloud filestore instances list
  gcloud redis instances list
  gcloud spanner instances list
  gcloud sql instances list
  gcloud compute instance-groups list

configuration of service account in Azure Devops
Following the following steps we will securely configure the Google Cloud credentials called "service account" with which we will connect to the project in the cloud.

We get our service account file "service-account-total-control-azure.yml"
Inside Azure Devops we go to Pipelines/Library/Secure files/
We upload the file "service-account-total-control-azure.yml, we allow it to be used by all pipelines.

Pipeline that we will use
